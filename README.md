Create an Android application that will fetch information about the current Bitcoin market price and display the data in a graph of your choosing.

The application must:
- make a network call to a remote api resource to fetch the current exchange rate data, it is not
- necessary to demonstrate authentication or oauth processes,
- effectively make use of threading and asynchronous behaviour,
- show understanding of the Android SDK and application / activity lifecycles,
- be performant and make appropriate use of background tasks,
- show market price data over time using an appropriate graph.

We ask you to create your own implementation of your chosen graph and custom view
components, please do not use a third party library on this component.
